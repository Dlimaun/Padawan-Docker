You will need to download and install these tools.

If you are on **Mac Os X** or **Windows** you will need to install

But there's an all in one installers for boot2docker that comes with *VirtualBox*.

* [NodeJs](https://github.com/Padawan-org/Padawan-Docker/tree/nodeJs)

# Setup
It's simple, after instalation you will need to Change these files to match your project
* Dockerfile
* docker-compose.yml

# How to use
If you are using *boot2docker* start it using these command bellow. [Learn more](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker#how-to-use)

To Build your containers, this will look at you docker-compose.yml.

Run your containers

		$ docker-compose up

Stop your containers

		$ docker-compose stop

Run a command in a new container

		$ docker-compose run <container name on docker-compose.yml> <command>

List your containers from *docker-compose.yml*

		$ docker-compose ps
		
List your all running containers

		$ docker ps

Run a command in a existing container, needs the previous command result

		$ docker exec -i -t <container id or name> <command>
